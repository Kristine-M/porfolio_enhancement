            <p>To run the program, you need to choose a menu option from 1-8. Then, depending 
                on your choice you input a name and whichever contact type you want to add or 
                change. This contact type needs to be spelled exactly as one of the 
                following: "Phone number", "Email", "Additional info" or else you will get flagged 
                in the program. To export a contact list into a file, please use the "export.txt" 
                file as your file name. To import contacts into your list, please use the "import.txt" 
                file as your filename.

            <img align = "left" src="pictures/library.png" width = "100" alt="library icon">
            <p>Since I recieved feedback about separating and oraganizing my classes into 
                different files, I made different modules for each of the classes needed. 
                I then made a main where all the user interactions happen. Put together, 
                this program then allows one to check out books, or added certain books 
                and authors to the library database.
