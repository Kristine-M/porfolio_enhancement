            <h2><b>Background + Education</b></h2>
            <p>I am born and raised in Chicago. I currently and studying Computer Science and Design at UIC
                because ever since I was a child, I loved creating things and seeing the results of the creational
                process. This led me to cs, in which I am aiming to become a software engineer and or a UI/UX designer.
